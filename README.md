# R-Project-RNASeq-Package

I created this package for the determination of RNA Sequence from DNA Sequence using Simple Statistics.
For the package, I used S4 Object-Oriented System and Packages like Biostrings and Rcpp.
Here, I created a function named "rna_from_dna" which does the determination of RNA sequence from DNA sequence with the help of Simple Statistics.
