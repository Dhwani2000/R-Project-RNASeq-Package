# R-Project-RNASeq-Package

I created this package for the determination of RNA Sequence from DNA Sequence using Simple Statistics.
For the package, I used S4 Object-Oriented System and Packages like Biostrings and Rcpp.
Here, I created a function named "rna_from_dna" which does the determination of RNA sequence from DNA sequence with the help of Simple Statistics.


Moreover, you can find a summary for my package in my blog post. Here, is the link for my blog: https://dhwanisangani.blogspot.com/2023/04/r-project-rnaseq-package.html
